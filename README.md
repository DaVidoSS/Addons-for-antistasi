# Addons-for-antistasi

This is set of some modular scripted gameplay improvements for Barbolani's Antistasi.
You can use them all or some.

***************************************************************************************

1.  Copy improvements directory into Scripts directory in your copy of antistasi mission

***************************************************************************************

2.  Automatic gear collector for dead corpse and boxes.

Every dead body will have an action RED for gather every single gear element of dead unit to nearest vehicle.
Every box besides base boxes will have an action (WHITE)for gather box inventory to nearest vehicle.
Vehicle need to be unlocked or his owner in your group. Vehicle also can not be unmobilized.

2a. Add at bottom initFuncs.sqf

ROB_fnc_collector = compileFinal preProcessFileLineNumbers "Scripts\improvements\ROB_fnc_collector.sqf";
ROB_fnc_remRobAction = compileFinal preProcessFileLineNumbers "Scripts\improvements\ROB_fnc_remRobAction.sqf";
ROB_fnc_addactions = compileFinal preProcessFileLineNumbers "Scripts\improvements\ROB_fnc_addactions.sqf";
ROB_fnc_getOwner = compileFinal preProcessFileLineNumbers "Scripts\improvements\ROB_fnc_getOwner.sqf";

 
2b. Add in initPlayerLocal.sqf at very below:

0 = [] spawn ROB_fnc_addactions;

***************************************************************************************

3. Current client/server/HC performance load displayed on map
This will show your fps count, server load, and hc client constantly on the map in left bottom corner.
Marker text will change color according to current load.

3a. Add in init.sqf at very below

0 = [] execVM "Scripts\improvements\show_fps.sqf";

***************************************************************************************

4. TFAR side improvements. Require Task Force Radio mod
By default if you take over enemy vehicle use LR and speak witch your team will be not available.
This will change this behavior on every vehicle in game.
After you add this every vehicle (civilian too) will have a LR radio with proper side coding. MP PVP friendly!


4a1. If you want that the players frequency of ch1 for LR and Sw gets automatically set to some number generated by server:
Add in init.sqf at very below:

0 = [true] execVM "Scripts\improvements\TFAR_autofreq.sqf";


4a2. Without auto channel freq but still with proper radio code for captured enemy vehicles.
Add in init.sqf at very below:

0 = [false] execVM "Scripts\improvements\TFAR_autofreq.sqf";

***************************************************************************************

5. Vehicle auto flip. Adds event fired when vehicle is upturned. It also adds small screen info when using garage.
After crew leave vehicle and go about 10m away vehicle will automatically turn back to normal position.
